- dont' just pile on CSS like it's the wild west
- use a system - either a library or a "method"
- CSS modules
- utilise your js library if there is local/modular style support in there
- it will become unmanagable you may end up serving the user more CSS than they need
- avoid, at all costs, the situation where you are scared to delete any css in case it breaks something
