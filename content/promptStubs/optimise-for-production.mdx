title: Optimise for production
category: general
difficulty: easy
status: stub

- Saves data and increases speed / makes CPU work less hard
- use minified versions of JS, CSS from CDN in production
- read the optimisation guides for the libraries you are using
- use tooling to minify your own HTML, CSS and JS
- Note that tailwindcss is large _by design_ - 3MB in development - but this is never intended to be deployed.
- If you cannot use tooling, use online tools
