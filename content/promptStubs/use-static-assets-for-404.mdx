title: Use static assets for 404s etc.
category: backend
difficulty: easy
status: stub
---

- there is no need to "compute" or "generate" a 404 page
- serve these from static assets
- if possible, serve from frontend
- if not possible, tap out of the request at the earliest point (dont do a bunch of calculation and THEN decide that there is no page / the user is not allowed to see it)
