- if something is widely useful, open source it
- the collective mind of the community will lead to more optimisation
- if everyone uses a single component, enhancements to that components' code are felt by many people
- alternative is that everyone builds individually and we reinvent a bunch of wheels
- don't make your own thing, contribute code to an existing one
- could end up in a CDN
