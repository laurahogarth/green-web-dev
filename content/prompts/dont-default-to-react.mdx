title: Don't default to React
category: javascript
difficulty: medium

The [React](https://reactjs.org/) library currently dominates the UI landscape in terms of [adoption](https://www.npmtrends.com/angular-vs-react-vs-vue) and is supported by a huge ecosystem of components and plugins, however you should not simply default to choosing it because it is popular - weight up the pros and cons of the alternatives and make an informed choice. React is an excellent library, but there are smaller, less CPU-intensive alternatives that help conserve batteries and save on data over the wire.

## For people who really like React

Consider [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

If you are very attached and bought-in to React or its ecosystem, consider trialling **Preact**. It aims to maintain parity with React in terms of its API (there are [a few differences](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/differences-to-react) but nothing major) which means you can try it out simply by using [bundler aliases](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/switching-to-preact). React and React-DOM combined deploy a runtime that clocks in at around 140kb out of the box (you can get it as low as 40kb if you go to town on optimisation) - you pay that data cost before you write a single line of your own code, simply by choosing React. The runtime for Preact, by comparison, clocks in at just over 3kb.

## For people who are happy to learn a new library

Consider [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

The battle lines are constantly shifting in terms of runtime sizes, so it's impossible to say which library, at time of writing, has the smallest runtime... or is it? With its revolutionary approach, **Svelte** presents a new way of thinking about frontend libaries by breaking from the meta and forging its own path;

- Svelte is a compiler - it does not deploy a runtime (the runtime for Svelte is therefore 0kb).
- Svelte has abandoned the virutal DOM approach that dominated the current generation of Javascript framrworks.

The Virtual DOM point is an important one from a sustainability perspective - Svelte creator Rich Harris describes the Virtual DOM as [pure overhead](https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead) and he's right - the VDom is simply a means to an end, it doesn't bring any inherent advantages to you as a developer other than being a lot more efficient than the first generation of Javascript frameworks.

The worst part about this is that many React developers today are basically treating React as if it was a compiler (building from the command line, deploying minified artefacts) but are not getting any of the benefits! This is why many people believe that Svelte (along with its contemporaries such as [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)) represent the next generation of JavaScript libraries.
