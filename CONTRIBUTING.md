# Contributing

It is our intention that this website be contributable to by the whole of the web developer community. In order to achieve this, we do need to set a few principles and guidelines around contributing (expect these to evolve over time).

## The first rule

Before spending any significant time on any contribution, [raise an issue on our github](https://github.com/mikeyhogarth/green-web-dev/issues).

## Contributing a Prompt

Prompts should be quick, digestible bits of advice that can help reduce the carbon footprint of a web application, generally this will either be through reducing CPU cycles or reducing data usage by a significant amount.

There are a myriad of ways to save data and CPU cycles so any prompts should be fairly wide-reaching/widely applicable and broad. We don't want to end up just listing every single way to make your code more efficient or we'll be here forever!

The first paragraph should **open with a statement that summarises the entire prompt** and should include a **solid reason that this matters from a sustainability perspective**. The carbon footprint element to this should not be tenuous - it should be direct and explained.

Prompts should not press a developer to sacrifice code quality or maintainability - if quality is a tradeoff for adopting the advice, state this clearly within the prompts somewhere (probably with its own section) - in reality, things like this should probably not be prompts.

A prompt **Should** have the following properties;

- It should be completely readable in **less than 2 minutes**
- Where applicable, the prompt should include good examples and bad examples.
- Where applicable, [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) links should be provided.
- The prompt should end with some useful links for futher reading, allowing the user to continue investigating the topic should they want to.

## Contributing a Resource

For the time being, resources on this site are core-team only, however if you see a resource written elsewhere that is pertinant to any of the prompts, you are free to suggest it as a relevant link.
